# Rusty-echo

## Introduction

This is a rust-practice project of mine where the goal is to copy the unix command `echo` using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Installation

1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Make sure `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is in you path and do `cargo install --path .`.

## Guide

There is not much to do as of now, but it will echo back any text you give it,
aswell as showing some info when the `--help` or `-h` flag is given. You can also do
`-V` or `--version` to show version information.
